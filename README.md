## What is it?

Buku Peek connects to your existing Buku bookmark database on your local machine and displays those bookmarks within your browser. It's a simple viewer—not a manager—that gives you instant access to the bookmarks you've saved with the Buku command-line tool.

## Features
- ✅ View all your Buku bookmarks in a clean, minimal interface
- ✅ Search bookmarks by title, URL, or tags
- ✅ Dark and light themes
- ✅ Direct access to your existing Buku database
- ✅ No bookmark duplication—what you see is what's in your Buku database.

## Installation

Buku Peek consists of two components that work together:

1. The browser extension
